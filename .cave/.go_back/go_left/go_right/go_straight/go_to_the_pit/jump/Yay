Yay! You made it! Good job!

If you did it perfectly on the first try, you should have only used 'cd' 6 times.

If not, you fell for a 'symbolic link.' Symbolic links are like 'shortcuts.' Many of
the symbolic links would have taken you an arbitrary number of parent directorys backwards,
or did some other evil stuff.

You can create a symbolic link of your own doing this:

$ ln -s name_of_thing_the_link_to name_of_your_link

This concludes the scavenger hunt!

To prove that you finished... here is a code:

Have fun!
