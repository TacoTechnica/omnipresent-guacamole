Part 4!

On *nix filesystems, such as Linux and Mac OSX, a period ('.') at the beginning of a filename
or folder name will mark the file or folder as 'hidden.' Hidden files, as you've discovered,
require special options to see, and are usually used to hide important files, debug files (like
logs, error messages, etc.), or required program files (like custom libraries for games) from
normal viewing.

If these files and folders were NOT hidden, a normal 'ls' or opening of a file browser would be
extremely cluttered. Usually, developers and software engineers will hide files that the user
normally would never look at, open, or otherwise use.

On Windows systems, whether a filesystem object is hidden or not is an ATTRIBUTE of the item,
along with such things as whether the file is read-only and a system file (i.e., a file that is
critical to the operation of the operating system).

Let's get on to part 4!

There's a rather... large file here. Aptly named... "large_file". You'll probably go mad scrolling
through it... but too bad. Look for "Thou shalt find this line". Though this line may be broken up
into multiple lines.

You might need some help with this... Thankfully, GNU has a nice tool for you!
Look up the Gnu Regular Expression Parser!
